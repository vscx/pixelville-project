# **What is Pixelville?**

We, together, are a small community of Minecraft roleplayers that just looove to write and think of their own stories and manage their character's life in our territory, political and trading systems.  
  
We are living in a voluminous bordered world - which is there to represent the round earth - that contains a different islands, some of them being bigger or smaller than others. You can review an always-updating map in a graphic right underneath this paragraph or on the main page of the manual.  
  
Players can feel free to either join or create a city. But don't have to. Where everything has its own advantage and disadvantages, you might also live as an buccaneer, pioneer or sail around like a pirate. There are no borders for anyone's creativity in terms of designing their own character and roleplaying with other players that play out a role of their desire.
It is also possible to settle furthermore than only cities or towns. We offer lots of different things as empires, ships, shops, jobs, families, titles (nobility, science or medicine) and more.  
  
Ever heard of the game Anno? Well if yes, you already know the most of our server's principle. :)

# **Rules & Stuff.**

We do have a rule system though. And it is quite strict.  
  
Please review our general rule articles in the manual for an explicit review into these. It is recommended to have taken a look into the set being new to the server and its system. Here a little summary of the most important things:  
  
 * Every player, being it a members of our administrative team or just a newbie joining our community will be treated equally. There are no exceptions.
 * We are strict roleplaying. Which means that you have to roleplay with other players or just being close to them. Learn more about roleplaying.
 * Players have to follow a set of morals that include important things about everyone's behaviour in contact with players or administrators. Learn more about our set or morals.
 * Every player has a right of being forgotten and forgiven. The specific player though has to indicate a recognizable meaning and reason why.


# **Features.**
To - finally - get you started properly though after reading (I hope you did ^^) this boring and extremely prolonged description of our server, we've decided to give some redirects to interesting (they are!) things about our server, that you should definitely review.




**[community.pixelville.me](https://community.pixelville.me)**
The heart of the whole server and its community where everything and everyone has its own and unique colours and opinions. A platform to either communicate within your Character or for yourself as the player in front of the monitor.  
We offer a forum for each city and empire there, to either spread information on black boards or through narratives (folktales) in a roleplayie way!
  

**Definitions** *— pssh.. Important!*
Before getting into it too quickly, let's have a look at what you will be reading and what it means. :p
  

**Set of Rules** *— pssh.. Important!*
The law book that monitors every action on the server and effects literally everyone in the community.  
It's recommended to have read and know its contents to be sure not to break any of our global rules.
  

**Set of Moral** *— pssh.. Important!*
The law book for actions that exists to confer our rule system and administration a bit of humanity. Dignity and equability are far not the same thing that needs to be equalised. Apprehending different opinions and always having an eye open for peoples condition of sentience is written in capital letters.
  

**Creating a Character**
A character creation leaves you almost unlimited options in design and creativity to his or her name, story, age, appearance or family.  
We love to see every kind of different variants when styling your own character. :)  
After sketching your character shapes, it will have to be approved by our system, which may take a few moments to proceed. You can - of course - play during that time.
  

**How to Roleplay**
The actually most important part of playing here. It is not a usual ›playing‹, as you might've already taken into account. It is roleplaying, which makes the difference. As some people don't know how to roleplay with their character, we've set up an instructions onto exemplary roleplaying with other characters. :p  
Have a look even if you are experienced! Also: Types of Roleplay.
  

**Cities & Towns**
Every city or town has its own name, place and citizen. It may be part of an empire or just a standalone. Cities will have to enroll a registration with the Government of Pixelville to become an official and take part in legal trading or join empires.  
Cities / Towns have to have a mayor or president that may be switched whenever elections in democracy, monarchy, republic take place. Dictatorships are also possible. This may vary when being governed by empires or other exceptions including hostage taking, fraud or assassination / deaths.
  

**Empires & Territories**
An even bigger - being the biggest - system that borders and puts another layer onto the city & town system is the Empire & Territories system.  
We differentiate between the two keywords though because Empires more declares the roleplaying system in which political, radical or war-relating things play over. Territories are more the areas, surfaces or even expanses that are being taken into account by cities, towns, buccaneers and more.  
We also split the definition Territories into two meanings: One being for areas in general and the other being for entire islands, peninsulas or island chains. Being registered or not.
  

**Ships**
Oh, I love this feature. — So, we have a ship system on the server, which will make it possible to seriously live the 14th to 15th century. :)  
Ships are objects that can be expensively bought at official or unofficial shipyards or build within a long process that requires lots of goods and money.  
They are nothing more than floating islands, in shape and form of .. ships! They move very slow but have an option to carry players and objects such as filled chests and more with them. They can also be used to create an occupation until food runs out, if you don't fish enough. :p
